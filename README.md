# Programming in Python through the famous hand game "Rock-Paper-Scissors"

[Girls in Tech Luxembourg](https://luxembourg.girlsintech.org/) delivered a workshop on school students (11-21 yo) during the [National Jonk Fuerscher Contest](https://fjsl.lu/) in Luxembourg on Sunday 19th March 2023.

This git repo provides all the necessary code on how to develop a famous and fun hand game "rock - paper - scissors" using the Python programming language.

There are two different files on the code:
* [RockPaperScissors_V1.py](https://github.com/girlsintech-lux/rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/RockPaperScissors_V1.py) includes a first simple version of the code, where all the commands are passed directly inside the file. This source code is the perfect place to start in order to understand the logic
* [RockPaperScissors_V2.py](https://github.com/girlsintech-lux/rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/RockPaperScissors_V2.py) brings the same result but through a more challenging game for the students. There are specific functions that are created for each action, which organize better the code, and make it more readable and more performant.
